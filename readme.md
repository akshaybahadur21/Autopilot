## Facial Recognition
This code helps in facial recognition using facenets (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf). The concept of facenets was originally presented in a research paper.
The main concepts talked about triplet loss function to compare images of different person.
This concept uses inception network which has been taken from source and fr_utils.py is taken from deeplearning.ai for reference.
I have added several functionalities of my own for providing stability and better detection. 


### Code Requirements
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

##### pip install requirements.txt

### Description
A facial recognition system is a technology capable of identifying or verifying a person from a digital image or a video frame from a video source. There are multiples methods in which facial recognition systems work, but in general, they work by comparing selected facial features from given image with faces within a database.

### Functionalities added
1) Detecting face only when your eyes are opened. (Security measure)
2) Using face align functionality from dlib to predict effectively while live streaming.


### Python  Implementation

1) Network Used- Inception Network
2) Original Paper - Facenet by Google

If you face any problem, kindly raise an issue

### Procedure

1) If you want to train the network , run `Train-inception.py`, however you don't need to do that since I have already trained the model and saved it as 
`face-rec_Google.h5` file which gets loaded at runtime.
2) Now you need to have images in your database. The code check `/images` folder for that. You can either paste your pictures there or you can click it using web cam.
For doing that, run `create-face.py` the images get stored in `/incept` folder. You have to manually paste them in `/images folder`
3) Run `rec-feat.py` for running the application.
